			<P>The Canadian Fallen Firefighters Foundation’s (CFFF) first major goal was the construction of the Canadian Firefighters Memorial (CFM) in the     nation’s capital, Ottawa. On Sunday September 9, 2012 that goal was reached!</p>

				<p>The journey began in 2003 with the proposal to federal government to erect a national monument in the capital to honour all firefighters who have died in the line of duty including wildland, full-time, part-time, volunteer, military, airport and industrial. The National Capital Commission (NCC), which is responsible for major commemorations in the nation’s capital but does not fund them, accepted the proposal in March 2005 and allocated land for the CFM in the LeBreton Flats area of Ottawa close to the new War Museum, just to the west of Parliament Hill.</p>

				<p>Three months after NCC allocated the land, on June 10, 2005, the Foundation lobbied successfully to introduce private members Bill Motion 153 to “(a) recognize all firefighters who have fallen in the line of duty in Canada; (b) support the proposed CFFF mandate for the construction of a monument in the parliamentary precinct containing the names of all Canadian firefighters who have died in the line of duty; and (c) send a message to the Senate acquainting the Upper House of the decision of this house.” In October 2005, the project received government endorsement when the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced the site in the House of Commons.</p>

				<p>The Foundation continued to fundraise over $1.5 million over the next few years but was still short of the amount needed. In September 2009, years of further fundraising and lobbying came to fruition with the approval of $2.4 million in funding announced by the Minister of Heritage, James Moore.</p>

				<p>A national design competition, coordinated by the CFFF in conjunction with the NCC, was launched in January 2010 and on September 9, 2010 the Foundation announced the winning design - “We Were There” by the team of Vancouver artist Douglas Coupland and landscape architect Mary Tremain of PLANT Architects in Toronto.</p>

				<p>“I wanted the monument to convey deep emotion and simple dignity,” said artist Douglas Coupland. “I want people to eat their lunch there, read, play with their kids — and each time they do so, a small part of themselves will reflect on firefighters and what they do every day when they go to work.”
